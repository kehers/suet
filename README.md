## Suet

*(This repo has now been put in read-only mode. No further work will continue on the open source version. If you are looking for a solution for detailed analytics and reporting for your transactional emails, as well sending broadcasts and creating automations using your existing messaging infrastructure, checkout [engage.so](https://engage.so/) ~~suet.co~~.If you need to setup your own version of Suet or build anything off SES/Mailgun analytics, this source is still a good place to start)*

Suet is an analytics dashboard and reporting tool for transactional emails through Mailgun or SES. It gives better insight into the performance of your transactional emails by providing answers to questions like:

- Who received what email? Which ones were opened? What links were clicked? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/suetco/suet/raw/master/public_html/static/images/screenshots/feed.png))
- Whatâ€™s user engagement like? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/suetco/suet/raw/master/public_html/static/images/screenshots/users.png))
- What device/platform are most used? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/suetco/suet/raw/master/public_html/static/images/screenshots/dashboard.png))
- Which email performed best? ([Screenshot](https://github.com/suetco/suet/raw/master/public_html/static/images/screenshots/email.png))
